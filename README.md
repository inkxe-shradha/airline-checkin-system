# Introduction

Hey Team, Thanks for being used my code. This is Shradha, Recently Joined the organization. Please excuse anything happened wrongly. Thanks and Regards.

# Features asked in the projects

=> Implemented `Material-UI`[Custom theming].
=> Implemented `Responsive` UI using the `SCSS`;
=> Implemented the state Management `NgRx > NgRx Effects > Services` store.
=> Implemented the Form module design in both `Template Driven Approach` and `Reactive Approach` [VALIDATION];
=> Implemented the `PWA` features.
=> Performance score likely more than `70%`.
=> Because of time constraint not able to fully optimize the app. But in some cases used `components` usages in DRY methodology.

# Credential and Guid

=> As instructed there are two access based credentials implemented `Admin` and `Staff`.
=> I used the JSON server for mocking like the database.
=> I used the Google authentication plugin for the google auto login features.

=> Form the auto login enabled you must need to be run the app either in `4200` or `3000(PROD)` mode url.
=> The URL are already being settee in the package.json.
=> Auth Guard and Router based authentication implemented.

[ADMIN] => Email => `admin@gmail.com` => `Admin@123`;
[USER] => Email => `user@gmail.com` => `User@123`;

# Run the commands to get started

=> Node need to be install.
=> Angular 13 Version (I used).
=> `npm i`
=> Start the app in dev => `npm start` => This will run both the app and the JSON server in port `4200` and `3100`;
=> Build the app => `ng build`.
=> Then Run the app => `npm run server` => This will run the app in production mode.
